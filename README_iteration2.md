# Iteration 2

### Listening Comprehension

As a student who wants to practice my understanding of spoken words in the language that I am learning, I want a listening comprehension mode. In this mode, numbers will appear in the prefilled cells and the corresponding word in the language that I am learning will be read out to me when I press the number.

### Vocabulary Lists

As a teacher, I want to specify a list of word pairs for my students to practice this week.  
As a student working with a textbook, I want to load pairs of words to practice from each chapter of the book.  
As a student, I want the Sudoku app to keep track of the vocabulary words that I am having difficulty recognizing so that they will be used more often in my practice puzzles.

### Different Devices

As a vocabulary learner practicing at home, I want to use my tablet for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that the words will be conveniently displayed in larger, easier to read fonts.  
As a vocabulary learner taking the bus, I want to use my phone in landscape mode for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that longer words are displayed in a larger font that standard mode.
