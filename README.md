## Puzzle End
As a student, I need to know when I have the correct solution to learn the language properly.
Example: When a student enters all the squares to the Sudoku puzzle, the app should check and display a test to indicate if the solution is correct or not.

## Selection GUI
As a student, I want to be able to select a desired number to place on the board.
Example: A 3 by 3 grid will be available at the bottom of the screen to pick a desired number to fill in a blank spot.
         The student can select the desired number from the 3 x 3 grid then select board position to set board values.
