### Initial Goal
As a student, I want to be able to learn Chinese by playing a Sudoku style game. I want to get familiar with the words by playing this game.
Example: The game will have two modes, students can choose the mode they like to play the game. It can help the student to get familiar with the languages they want.

### First Game
As a language learner, I would like to start with the numbers at first. I want to learn 1 - 9 in Chinese.
Example: User will input numerical number into a Chinese puzzle, and input Chinese numbers into a regular puzzle to play.

### Puzzle End
As a student, I need to know when I have the correct solution to learn the language properly.  
Example: There is a "submit" button that will check if the current solution is correct.

### Selection GUI
As a student, I want to be able to select a desired number to place on the board.  
Example: A 3 by 3 grid will be available at the bottom of the screen to pick a desired number to fill in a blank spot.  
The student can select the desired number from the 3 x 3 grid then select board position to set board values.  
Example: A "delete" button is available so the user can press it then the desired position on the board to clear that spot.
         

### Language Selection
As a language learner, I want to be able to peek at the correct translation of a word, so that I can try to remember it in filling out the puzzle.  
Example: A "switch" button is available to switch the languages back and forth. This way, the learner can peak as they play the game.  
Note: Variable is available in MainActivity.java to switch initial lanugages.

### Listening Comprehension

As a student who wants to practice my understanding of spoken words in the language that I am learning, I want a listening comprehension mode. In this mode, numbers will appear in the prefilled cells and the corresponding word in the language that I am learning will be read out to me when I press the number.

### Vocabulary Lists

As a teacher, I want to specify a list of word pairs for my students to practice this week.  
As a student working with a textbook, I want to load pairs of words to practice from each chapter of the book.  
As a student, I want the Sudoku app to keep track of the vocabulary words that I am having difficulty recognizing so that they will be used more often in my practice puzzles.

### Different Devices

As a vocabulary learner practicing at home, I want to use my tablet for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that the words will be conveniently displayed in larger, easier to read fonts.  
As a vocabulary learner taking the bus, I want to use my phone in landscape mode for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that longer words are displayed in a larger font that standard mode.
